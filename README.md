# Nebula Loss Function: One Loss Function to Rule Them All! üåå

<img src="./nebula.png" width="1000px"></img>


Welcome to the **Nebula Loss Function**! A versatile and adaptive loss function that works with any model, dataset, or task. Experience the magic of a single loss function that dynamically adapts to your needs, making it easy and efficient to use in any deep learning project.

## Getting Started üåü

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9 or higher
- NumPy

### Installation
```sh
pip install nebula-loss'
```

### Usage

```python
import torch
from nebula import Nebula

# Instantiate the Nebula loss function
loss_function = Nebula()

# Define your model, dataset, and other components here

# Calculate loss using the Nebula loss function
loss = loss_function.compute_loss(y_pred, y_true)
```

## Features üöÄ
- Automatically determines the appropriate loss function for your task
- One-hot encoding for classification tasks
- Caching mechanism for efficient training
- Domain knowledge and user input integration
- Supports a variety of optimization techniques

## How it works üî≠

The Nebula loss function works by analyzing the characteristics of your model's predictions (`y_pred`) and the ground truth labels (`y_true`). Based on these characteristics, it automatically selects the most appropriate loss function for your task, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression or Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.

### Optimization Techniques

The Nebula loss function supports a variety of optimization techniques, such as:

1. Analyzing the range of values in `y_true`
2. Checking the distribution of values in `y_true`
3. Analyzing the dimensions of `y_pred`
4. Checking the sparsity of `y_true`
5. Analyzing the correlation between `y_pred` and `y_true`
6. Leveraging domain knowledge and user input
7. Analyzing the distribution of values in `y_pred`
8. Checking the balance of classes in `y_true`
9. Model selection techniques (requires a model and a dataset)
10. Utilizing user input or metadata

# Roadmap
1. Add in 5 more detections to effectively determine which loss function to utilize

2. Add in 5 more loss functions that the detections map to.

3. Create an entirely polymorphic version that has no shape whatsoever and fills up the data, task, model environment at runtime.

4. Create an implemented tree of thoughts search to determine loss function
