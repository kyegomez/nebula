# **Nebula Loss Function Selector**

Nebula Loss Function Selector is an open-source project that utilizes reinforcement learning to automatically select the optimal loss function for your machine learning model. By training an agent to choose the best loss function based on the state representation extracted from your data, Nebula Loss Function Selector aims to simplify the model training process and improve the performance of your model.

## **Features**

- Customizable loss function classes
- Reinforcement learning agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Easy integration with your existing machine learning pipeline
- Supports PyTorch

## **Installation**

To install Nebula Loss Function Selector, simply clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nebula-loss-function-selector.git
cd nebula-loss-function-selectorCopy code

```

## **Usage**

Here's a basic example of how to use Nebula Loss Function Selector:

```
import torch
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from nebula_loss_function_selector import NebulaOptimized, CrossEntropyLoss, MSELoss

# Train your model and obtain y_pred and y_true tensors
y_pred = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_true = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))

# Create an instance of NebulaOptimized
nebula_optimized = NebulaOptimized()

# Determine the optimal loss function for your model
nebula_optimized.determine_loss_function(y_pred, y_true)

# Print the selected loss function
print("Selected loss function:", nebula_optimized.loss_function)Copy code

```

## **Customization**

You can easily add your own custom loss functions by extending the **`LossFunction`** class:

```
from nebula_loss_function_selector import LossFunction

class CustomLoss(LossFunction):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def compute_loss(self, y_pred, y_true):
# Implement your custom loss computation logic here
        pass

    def __str__(self):
        return super().__str__()Copy code

```

Then, update the **`map_action_to_loss_function`** function in the **`LossFunctionEnv`** class to include your custom loss function.
