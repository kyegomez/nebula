This is an intriguing problem. The idea of a meta-loss function or a "loss function learning" algorithm such as Nebula would involve a fair degree of complexity. Here's a basic architecture and a simple algorithm to illustrate this concept, and I'll follow it with a Pythonic pseudocode:

**Architecture:**
1. The Nebula algorithm begins with a pool of candidate loss functions.
2. A Monte Carlo process is used to randomly select and initialize loss functions for various tasks.
3. Each selected loss function is used to train a separate ML model.
4. Each model's performance is evaluated using a validation set.
5. The performances serve as an input to a meta-learning algorithm which iteratively updates the probability distribution of the selection of loss functions.
6. The process is repeated multiple times until an optimal loss function is identified for the given task.

**Algorithmic Pseudocode:**
1. Initialize the list of candidate loss functions.
2. Initialize the distribution over the loss functions to be uniform.
3. For a number of iterations do:
    1. Sample a loss function from the distribution.
    2. Use the sampled loss function to train the model.
    3. Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the validation set.
    4. Update the distribution over the loss functions based on the performance.
4. The loss function with the highest probability in the distribution is chosen as the optimal loss function.

**Pythonic Pseudocode:**

The Python code will require a set of predefined loss functions and a method for updating the distribution based on performance. We also need a method for training the model with a specific loss function. Here's a simple Pythonic pseudocode.

Please note: this is a simplified version of the concept and should be elaborated to meet specific requirements in a real-world implementation.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define candidate loss functions
loss_functions = [loss_func1, loss_func2, loss_func3, ..., loss_funcN]

# Initialize a uniform probability distribution
prob_dist = np.ones(len(loss_functions)) / len(loss_functions)

# Define the model
model = MyModel()

# For a number of iterations
for i in range(num_iterations):

    # Sample a loss function based on the probability distribution
    chosen_loss_func = np.random.choice(loss_functions, p=prob_dist)

    # Train the model with the chosen loss function
    model.train(chosen_loss_func)

    # Evaluate the performance
    performance = model.evaluate(validation_set)

    # Update the distribution
    prob_dist = update_distribution(prob_dist, performance)

# Select the best loss function
best_loss_func = loss_functions[np.argmax(prob_dist)]
```

A real-world implementation would involve defining the `MyModel` class, the candidate loss functions, the `update_distribution` method, and the performance evaluation method. These components would need to be customized based on the specific requirements of your ML model and task.

This idea is an interesting exploration into the automatic selection of optimal loss functions. However, it's crucial to note that it's a theoretical construct, and real-world applications may need to deal with challenges such as computational efficiency, choosing an appropriate method for updating the distribution, and ensuring the robustness of the selected loss function across different datasets and tasks.
